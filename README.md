# PetTracker
This will be a project aimed at building a localized Pet Tracking system that
primarily relies on RSSI signal strength to locate a Pet within a local area
that is part of a private meshed WiFi network.  The Pet Tracking system will be
designed to ride on top of the Mesh network that I intend to use for home
automation as well.
